# Parent's Guide
The game contains mild graphic content such as pixel blood particles and textures and flashy effects. Both can be turned off. 
# Game Description
Hero on Parole is a game in which you have absolute power over fellow citizens and criminals. With great power, comes great responsibility! As the strongest man on the planet, you are expected to stop all present crimes. You start the game with 3 honour badges. You lose a badge whenever you do harm to a civilian or let a criminal escape. Also, you will be able to collect more honour badges as you keep fighting against crime while ensuring civilians' safety. How long will you be able to keep fighting crime without causing so much collateral damage? :)
